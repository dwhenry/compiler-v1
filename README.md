Simple compiler for a C subset

My first attempt (in 15 years) to build a compiler. I am reading one of my old university 
testbooks on compiler construction and following the exercises.

The compiler will initially only work for the prescibed c minus lanaguage which is a subset 
of C.

I have swtched the code to run on C++ so that I can write tests without needing some form 
of global stubbing.
